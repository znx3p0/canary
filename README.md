Canary is a distributed systems and communications framework, focusing on minimalism, ease of use and performance.

Please make sure that you use Serialize and Deserialize from Canary, since custom
implementations will be made to improve efficiency and wire cost.

Notable features of Canary:

The languages in which Canary will be supported are (in order):
- JavaScript (browser-only atm)
- Julia
- Python
