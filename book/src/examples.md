# Examples

To prepare yourself to build custom distributed systems,
you will have to build a set of distributed systems with Sia.

Some examples have been prepared for you to build along,
and a final challenge for you to try building individually.

The examples you have to build are the following (in order):
- An RPC system.
- A pub-sub server.
- A key-value in-memory database.

Do note that it is assumed that you have used the Rust programming language
and are comfortable with it, as some of these projects can be demanding.

If you still don't understand how things work, don't be afraid to take a look
at the code, since the codebase is relatively small; Sia is implemented in ~600 sloc,
and igcp (the library that provides channels) is implemented in ~900 sloc.
