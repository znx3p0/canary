# Examples

To prepare yourself to build custom distributed systems,
you will have to build a set of distributed systems with Sia.

Some examples have been prepared for you to build along,
and a final challenge for you to try building individually.

The examples you have to build are the following (in order):
- The Raft consensus algorithm
- An RPC system
- A distributed key-value store

Do note that it is assumed that you have extensive knowledge of the Rust language,
as some of these projects can be demanding, and a knowledge of procedural macros
is also needed for the RPC system.
