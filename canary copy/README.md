# Canary

Canary is a distributed systems library for making
communications through the network easier.

NOTE ABOUT STABILITY:

Canary is based upon the principle of atomicity,
and some of the current structures canary offers are not atomic;
what this means in simple terms is that they can be built on top
of other abstractions, hence, breaking the principle of atomicity.
This means that you should expect a different API on 0.2.
